## 📰 Project Title: Fake News Detection Model

### 🌟 Overview

This is my first repository, and it is dedicated to building and analyzing a model for the detection of fake news articles. The goal is to classify text inputs as either **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK (or specify the actual libraries you plan to use)
* **Model:** Specify the type of model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or a Deep Learning model like LSTM
